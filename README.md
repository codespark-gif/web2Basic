## Step 6: Link Local Repository to GitHub
1. Run `git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git` to link your local repository to the GitHub repository.
2. Run `git branch -M main` to rename the default branch to "main" (if necessary).

## Step 7: Push Changes to GitHub
1. Run `git push -u origin main` to push the committed changes to the GitHub repository.

## Verify the Changes
